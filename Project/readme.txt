Modules required:
express , multer , body-parser, mongoose, ejs , path , jsonwebtoken , express-session

How to:
For the frontend:
the pages are in a folder called "views" and their corresponding css files and resources are in folders called "Styles", "Images", and "Fonts"
the "DOM scripts" folder contains the "script.js" file that contains methods used in the ejs files

For the backend:
the "server.js" file is the main server that should be run ('nodemon server.js')
the files included in the Server folder are required by the main server
the server uploads all images to the "uploads" folder

For testing:
you will first see a signin/signup page where you can either create an account or use a pre-existing user (Youssef pass123)
