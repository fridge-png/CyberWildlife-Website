# CyberWildlife Website
Website that allows users to view wifelife and share experiences. 
This website was made as a part of my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree.

## Funcionality:

The website uses HTML/CSS/Javascript with EJS for the frontend, express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Running

For the frontend:
The pages are in a folder called "views" and their corresponding css files and resources are in folders called "Styles", "Images", and "Fonts"
The "DOM scripts" folder contains the "script.js" file that contains methods used in the ejs files

For the backend:
The "server.js" file is the main server that should be run ('nodemon server.js')
The files included in the Server folder are required by the main server
The server uploads all images to the "uploads" folder

### Testing

You will first see a signin/signup page where you can either create an account or use a pre-existing user (Youssef pass123)
